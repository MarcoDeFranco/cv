          <h2>Java: 8.5/10</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="bioParagraph">
          My first programming language. My first love. Also, the first thing
          that had me staring at the screen, asking myself "why doesn't it work?"
          when it wouldn't compile or, even worse, "why does it work?" when my
          program did everything it was supposed to.<br>
          I learned java during my first year of university and, after a rocky
          start, i managed to sustain both the basic and advanced exams, earning
          a 26 and a 25, respectively.<br>
          The only reason why i limited my personal score on my knowledge level
          on this language to 8.5/10 is that, to me, a 10/10 would mean knowing
          everything from the std libraries. However, i know how to navigate them
          and how to write a legible, solid and decently optimized program with
          them. If you have any question, i can't wait to answer them during an
          interview!
        </p>

          <h2>C++: 8/10</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="bioParagraph">
          It started off like as easy language (the first lessons were about
          variables, operators, functions and structs). Then pointers came along.
          I remember trying all the combinations of & and * until the program did
          what i wanted it to do. But those days are gone (or so it seems). Other
          than that, i've managed to learn the basics, work with OOP and
          optimizing the RAM's work with it. It's a solid, although absolutely
          not beginner-friendly language.

          <h2>HTML: 7.5/10</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="bioParagraph">
          I know enought of HTML to integrate it with CSS and Javascript.
          If, however, you need a more tangible proof, know that i used that
          knowledge to create this website. Also, i'm attempting to lern as much
          as i can from the libraries described on
          <a class="visibleLink" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">

          <h2>CSS: 7.5/10</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="bioParagraph">
          As i said about HTML, i know CSS enough to integrate it with the first
          language and build this website. Also for this language, i'm attempting
          to lern as much as i can from the libraries described on
          <a class="visibleLink" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">
            <strong>W3Schools</strong></a>.

        <p class="bioParagraph">
          I'm following a Udemy course at the moment. After learning all the
          other languages, it has honestly been very easy to pick up and, at
          this pace, i'll have a solid basis within the end of October 2022.
        </p>
        <div class="outsetBox">
          <h2>C#: work in progress</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="bioParagraph">
          I actually started to stidy it a few years ago and and went all the
          way to OOP with it, but i had to stop for work-related issues.
          If all goes according to plans, i'll be able to pick it back up within
          the next few months.

          <h2>English: 9.5/10</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="bioParagraph">
          For not being my native language, english comes the closest to being
          natural to me (just know that i'm writing the english version of this
          website first (without using Google translate, and i'll face all the
          consequences that come with it) and then i'll translate everything
          into italian).<br>
          I could tell you all the nice words that native speakers said to me
          but, to be realistic, i know you wouldn't care (rightfully so). That's
          why i'm getting in touch with a few schools to get the B2 First
          certificate. Unfortunately, it may not happen before summer 2023 but,
          in the meanwhile, i'll be happy to conduct a full job interview
          speaking english exclusively.

          Just Blender, for family and close friends, i've been using this 3D
          modeling software since 2014 and i've made quite a few interesting
          3D models, rigs and animations (unfortunately i don't have the habit
          of making screenshots and sharing my work, but you can find some of it
