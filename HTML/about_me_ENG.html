          <h2>Early life</h2>

        <p class="bioParagraph">
          I was born on June the 11th 1994 in San Giovanni in Fiore, a small
          Calabrian town in the province of Cosenza. in 2004, my parents decided
          to move to the intercity of Milan and, i have to say, being in a city
          with traffic lights and more than a single movie theater was
          mindblowing, at the time.<br>
          Moving on to 2008, i chose to follow my passion for scientific
          subjects, as well as english, by chosing what was called "Liceo
          linguistico - progetto Brocca", a kind of school specialized in
          foreign languages and scientific subjects such as physics and math.<br>
          In 2013, i graduated with a score of 84/100 and decided to immediately
          throw myself in the working environment and, obviously, it was hard
          to find employment, at first, so i opted to increase my possibilities
          by going to university. Of course, in a short matter of time, the
          first employment opportunities came along, but that's what the next
          section i for.
        </p>
        <div class="outsetBox">
          <h2>Work experience</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="bioParagraph">
          The first opportunities i found were some tutoring lessons i offered
          to my friends' relatives and other people via word spreading. English
          and middle school-level scientific subjects were my fields of choice.
          Within a couple of months, i got offered opportunities as a dog sitter,
          a baby sitter and a one-month contract (non renewable) as a secretary
          (which single-handedly paid for my yearly student fee, so i can't compain).<br>
          Then, in 2016, i found my first regular and (sort of) stable job as
          a waiter. This is the first time i had to actually deal with customers
          and they loved me (aside from the time, during my first week, in which
          i dropped a pizza on a table). I also learned how to properly mop a
          floor (it requires a perfect balance between strenght and gentleness,
          definitely not for everyone).<br>
          At last, but not least, in august of 2017, i found a job as a cashier
          for a hypermarket. I started on an 8 hours per week contract (although
          the overtime were a given and i happily made some extra money) and,
          after a year, they offered an open-ended contract, with my weekly
          hours increased to 18 (and more overtime, which were always well
          recieved).<br>
          I've been working there for the last five years, with overtime taking
          away my studying time but allowing me to live on my own and gain
          economical independance, which has always been a priority of mine.
          Anyway, it was still a part-time job and, as much as i got along with
          my coworkers and enjoyed all the compliments from my elderly female
          customers, i knew i didn't want the rest of my life to be like that so,
          by june of 2022, along with an opportunity that encouraged me to do
          so, i gave my resignation and focused on my studies, as well as learned
          new programming languages, so that i could find a job that would be
          as satisfying as i imagine it would be challenging. Don't get me wrong,
          i learned a lot from all my experience and i am grateful to all my
          former employers, but i'm ready to find something that better suits
          me. Ideally, a programmer's job.

          <h2>What i bring to the table</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="bioParagraph">
          As you might have seen from my resume, i lack experience as a developer.
          So i hear you ask, why would you pick me over some 22 year old graduate
          with a 110 summa cum laude score?<br>
          Here's why.<br>
          As i already specified on my CV, whatever i lack in experience, i make
          up for in termis of sheer will. I've worked until 3 jobs at a time in
          the past, so hard work doesn't scare me, it challenges me and encourages
          me to grow professinally. Besides, i'm a very quick study (you'd notice
          it within the first weeks), a good problem solver (working as a cashier
          might be aesy to learn, but finding a quick solution while you're stuck
          for whatever reason and have 8 families in line, growing impatient is
          how you survive in that environment) and a social, proactive and
          respectful person.<br> I'm a good worker and, arrogantly enough, a
          choice you wouldn't regret.
