          <h2>Playing the guitar</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="bioParagraph">
          This is self-explanatory. I like to play my acoustic guitar from time
          to time. Many people say "it's good for the soul". I still think that
          there's a deeper meaning to that phrase. Nonetheless, it's true.<br>
          Does all of that stuff mean that i'm a good guitar player? No, it
          doesn't.<br>
          I like to consider myself an advanced beginner. Even though i've been
          playing on and off for about 14 years. Best to stay humble, sometimes.

          <h2>Sports</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="bioParagraph">
          I've played a bunch of different sports throughout my life, and i
          know i'm supposed to emphasize the ones that involve a lot of
          teamwork, like basketball and soccer but, first of all, i'm terrible
          at any sport involving a ball (except for bowling).<br>
          The sports that really loved (and, incidentally or not, have  taught
          me the most) martial arts and parkour.<br>
          The first ones implicitly require you to know yourself to a level that
          you would have never imagined. They also need you to analyze your
          opponent, learn as much as possible about their patterns from the way
          they act, how they move and their reactions. The deeper you get into
          practicing all of these sports, the more you realize the levels of
          control and context awareness they help you develop. Besides, they
          teach you a lot in terms of respect towards your teacher, your
          sparring partner and your opponent. Bonus point: the kicks are the
          coolest thing ever.<br>
          About parkour, i've only been able to practice it for 3 years, before
          saying goodbye to my full joint functionality. In this brief span of
          time, i've learned a lot about analyzing the problem, structuring an
          effective strategy and executing it in the cleanest way possible. in
          short: problem solving is essential. If you mess up, you'll fall down
          badly, bruise yourself, pop your shoulders out, etc. So i can't stress
          this enough: you need to think about a solid strategy.<br>
          Now, after scaring the soul out of you, i can conclude this part by
          saying that, despite it all, i enjoyed every moment of it, and i
          regret nothing (my shoulders might think differently).<br>
          Nowadays, i just go to the gym with my "gym-bro" to blow off some
          steam, prepare for the next summer and spot those in need at the
          bench-press.

          <h2>Videogames</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="bioParagraph">
          This time i'll be brief but, at the very least, i have to mention the
          reason that pushed to pursue programming. Videogames.<br>
          I remember learning the first if-else statements, while loops and
          recursive calls thinking "i wonder if i'm going to use one of these in
          my videogame". Nowadays, i can't face an end-section boss without
          thinking "i wonder how many events would trigger this exact behaviour".
